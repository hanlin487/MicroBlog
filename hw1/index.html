    <!-- So for this assignment I kind of treated it as a simple portfolio-ish website where it’s just 
    kind of supposed to be a sort of introduction to who I am. I didn’t really end up showcasing  
    lots of projects or whatnot like you would in a typical portfolio because it’s not wholly 
    relevant to who I am as a person. I decided to just keep it simple and put in the usual 
    features you might see in any other portfolio/website: a static top bar filled with whatever 
    (for now it’s just my name), a sidebar with a picture of me and a few contact links, and then 
    the main content in the middle occupying the most space on the website. For the color choices 
    I know there’s some weirdos that enjoy light mode, which I’m not one of, so just a typical 
    dark blue-ish background with white text that's consistent with most “dark modes” is what I 
    chose to go with. And then two text bodies, one that’s about me and a bit of my background. 
    The other is more my hobbies/interests which I didn’t go too terribly into detail about but 
    just gave some information about. Below that I decided to include an image gallery of a couple 
    images I’ve taken that I think are relevant to my interests/hobbies and also look somewhat 
    good enough to not hurt your eyes. Otherwise my site is pretty simple with a three section 
    layout, which when resized to be smaller becomes stacked on top of each other with the help 
    of a media query so that way each section has more space width-wise to be shown and not be so 
    cramped together. All in all it’s not too complicated and relatively simple and clean, which was the 
    aesthetic I was going for. I’m not particularly fond of making it all fancy and complex, 
    rather I prefer the clean, simplistic designs that are easy to look at and use. -->

            <div class="basic-text">
                <p>Hi! I'm Hanlin, currently an undergrad 4th year studying Computer Science at UC Davis.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm based in the Bay Area and aspire to be a software developer focusing mostly on web development, 
                    however I also have interests in areas like cloud development, site reliability, or software infrastructure.
                    I grew up around computers and have always been fascinated with them and continue to expand my understanding
                    and knowledge of them.

            <h3>interests</h3>
            <div class="basic-text">
                <p>A lot of my interests/hobbies are pretty basic: working out, cooking, photography, sports, traveling, etc. 
                    Essentally anything fun that has nothing to do with my career or education.
                </p>
                <p>I'm pretty heavily invested in basketball and enjoy watching and playing. Naturally due to being raised in
                    the Bay Area I'm a Warriors fan however I enjoy watching most NBA players play as well (except Joel Embiid and SGA).
                </p>
                <p>I've also always loved cars since I was a kid, and I plan on owning and modifying the cars that I'm interested in, when 
                    I'm financially able to support it.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of this, I mostly just spend every day keeping myself in good health since I spend so much time at my desk working
                    or playing video games.
