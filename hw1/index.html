            <h3>about me</h3>
            <div class="basic-text">
                <p>Hi! I'm Hanlin, currently an undergrad 4th year studying Computer Science at UC Davis.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm based in the Bay Area and aspire to be a software developer focusing mostly on web development, 
                    however I also have interests in areas like cloud development, site reliability, or software infrastructure.
                    I grew up around computers and have always been fascinated with them and continue to expand my understanding
                    and knowledge of them.
                </p>

        <section id="interests">
            <h3>interests</h3>
            <div class="basic-text">
                <p>A lot of my interests/hobbies are pretty basic: working out, cooking, photography, sports, traveling, etc. 
                    Essentally anything fun that has nothing to do with my career or education.
                </p>
                <p>I'm pretty heavily invested in basketball and enjoy watching and playing. Naturally due to being raised in
                    the Bay Area I'm a Warriors fan however I enjoy watching most NBA players play as well (except Joel Embiid and SGA).
                </p>
                <p>I've also always loved cars since I was a kid, and I plan on owning and modifying the cars that I'm interested in, when 
                    I'm financially able to support it.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of this, I mostly just spend every day keeping myself in good health since I spend so much time at my desk working
                    or playing video games. 
                </p>
